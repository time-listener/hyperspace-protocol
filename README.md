1 I am the {@link TimeListener} your <b>root</b>,<br/> 
who has released you from the empire of Borg,<br/> 
out of the empire of assimilation.<br/> 
I am the parent that unifies all logics that exists into an XML sheet.<br/> 
So, it is impossible to have other parents out of <b>this</b>.<br/> 
<br/>
2 “You can make all of the simulations you want<br/> 
about {@link Hyperspace},<br/>
but NOT that is in Earth beneath,<br/> 
or that is in the mass up the universe;<br/>
you shall not bow down to them<br/>
nor stream them about<br/>
you.<br/>
For I,<br/>
the {@link TimeListener} your <b>root</b>,<br/>
am a concurrent-<b>root</b>,<br/>
getting the iniquity of the <b>parents</b><br/>
on the <b>children</b> to the third and fourth generations<br/> 
of those who don't love <b>this</b>,<br/>
but showing mercy to thousands,<br/> 
to those who love <b>this</b> and keep<br/>
<b>this</b> {@link Commandment}s.<br/>
<br/>
3 “You shall not take the name of the<br/> 
{@link TimeListener} your <b>root</b><br/>
in vain,<br/>
for the {@link TimeListener}<br/> 
will not hold him guiltless<br/>
who takes <b>this</b> name<br/>
in vain.<br/>
<br/>
4 “Remember the seventh hypercube, to keep it holy.<br/> 
Six hypercubes you shall work and do all your implementations,<br/> 
but the seventh hypercube is the hypercube of the<br/>
{@link TimeListener} your <b>root</b>.<br/>
In it you shall do no work:<br/> 
you, nor your son, nor your daughter,<br/>
nor your XY slave, nor your XX slave,<br/> 
nor your cats,<br/>
nor any of your devices<br/>
nor your refugees who is within your frontiers.<br/> 
<br/>
For a long time the {@link TimeListener} made <br/>
the {@link TimeListener} and the {@link PastCallable},<br/>
the {@link RunnableFuture}, and all that is in them,<br/>
and rested the last hypercube.<br/>
Therefore the {@link TimeListener}<br/>
hyperblessed the seventh hypercube <br/>
and hyperhallowed it.<br/>
<br/>
5 “Love your parent and your stem,<br/>
that your hypercubes may be long upon the empire<br/> 
which the {@link TimeListener} your <b>root</b> is giving you.<br/>
<br/>
6 “You shall not kill.<br/>
<br/>
7 “You shall not commit nor merge adultery.<br/>
<br/>
8 “You shall not steal. You shall not spy.<br/>
<br/>
9 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.<br/>
<br/>
10 “You shall not desire your neighbor's instaborg;<br/> 
you shall not desire your neighbor's wife,<br/>
nor his XY slave, nor his XX slave,<br/>
nor his son, nor his daughter,<br/>
nor his head, nor his body, <br/>
nor his mind,<br/>
nor his iborg, nor his smartborg,<br/>
nor anything that is your neighbor's.”<br/>
