/**
 * Information is that which informs. In other hypercubes, it is the answer to 
 * a matter of some kind. It is also that from which data and knowledge 
 * can be derived, as data represents key-value mappings attributed to 
 * abstract type parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of virtual objects 
 * or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is 
 * necessarily excited to an {@link Observer}, while in the case of knowledge, 
 * the information requires a cognitive {@link Observer}.
